= Introduction
Scientific writing is a crucial part of the research process, allowing
researchers to share their findings with the wider scientific community.
However, the process of typesetting scientific documents can often be a
frustrating and time-consuming affair, particularly when using outdated tools
such as LaTeX. Despite being over 30 years old, it remains a popular choice
for scientific writing due to its power and flexibility. However, it also comes
with a steep learning curve, complex syntax, and long compile times, leading to
frustration and despair for many researchers.

```rs
fn main() {
  println!("Hello world");
}
```

#figure(

  ```rs
  fn main() {
    println!("Hello world!");
  }
  ```
)
